# How to Update latest.yml for GitHub Releases

When you create a new release, you need to update `latest.yml` to point to GitHub Releases URLs.

## Step 1: Get Your GitHub Release URLs

After creating a GitHub Release and uploading files:

1. Go to your release page: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-projects-pro-update-server/releases/tag/v1.0.4`
2. Right-click on each file → "Copy link address"
3. You'll get URLs like:
   ```
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-projects-pro-update-server/releases/download/v1.0.4/My%20Projects%20Pro%20Setup%201.0.4.exe
   https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-projects-pro-update-server/releases/download/v1.0.4/My%20Projects%20Pro%20Setup%201.0.4.exe.blockmap
   ```

## Step 2: Update latest.yml

Your `latest.yml` file should reference the GitHub Release URLs:

```yaml
version: 1.0.4
files:
  - url: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-projects-pro-update-server/releases/download/v1.0.4/My%20Projects%20Pro%20Setup%201.0.4.exe
    sha512: [YOUR_SHA512_HASH]
    size: [YOUR_FILE_SIZE]
  - url: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/my-projects-pro-update-server/releases/download/v1.0.4/My%20Projects%20Pro%20Setup%201.0.4.exe.blockmap
    sha512: [YOUR_BLOCKMAP_SHA512_HASH]
    size: [YOUR_BLOCKMAP_SIZE]
path: My Projects Pro Setup 1.0.4.exe
sha512: [YOUR_SHA512_HASH]
releaseDate: '2024-01-15T10:00:00.000Z'
```

## Step 3: Get SHA512 Hashes

The SHA512 hashes are generated by electron-builder. You can find them in:
- The original `latest.yml` from your build output
- Or calculate them manually (see below)

## Step 4: Calculate SHA512 (if needed)

If you need to calculate SHA512:

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
Get-FileHash -Path "My Projects Pro Setup 1.0.4.exe" -Algorithm SHA512
```

**Or use online tool:**
- Upload file to: https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha512_checksum.html

## Step 5: Commit and Push

1. Update `latest.yml` with GitHub Release URLs
2. Commit in GitHub Desktop
3. Push to GitHub
4. Render will auto-deploy

## Important Notes

- **URL Encoding**: Spaces in filenames become `%20` in URLs
- **Version Match**: Tag version should match `latest.yml` version
- **File Names**: Must match exactly (case-sensitive)
- **SHA512**: Must match the actual file hash

## Quick Reference

**GitHub Release URL Format:**
```
https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/releases/download/TAG/FILENAME
```

**Example:**
```
https://github.com/johndoe/my-projects-pro-update-server/releases/download/v1.0.4/My%20Projects%20Pro%20Setup%201.0.4.exe
```
